# Introduction

Welcome to the **Arches Installation Guide**. This document is intended to help you quickly get Arches running on your server. 

Once you have installed Arches there is a companion book to this one, the [**Arches User Guide**](http://www.archesproject.org/documentation), with more information about how to use the software, and how to join the Arches community, a growing online network of Arches developers and users.

## What do I need to know to use this guide?

Arches is designed to let you manage many types of cultural heritage data. And while we've tried to make it easy to install Arches, you'll need to make some decisions on how you wish to describe and manage the information that goes into Arches. But don't worry, we've also included lots of examples and well-thought-out defaults for setting up the software. 

So, installing Arches means loading software and deciding how you want to describe the cultural heritage information that's important to you. We've written this guide assuming that you are comfortable working with your computer's command line, and that you can edit text files with ease. 

That's it! Feel free to tap a colleague on the shoulder if you need a little help along the way, or check out the resources at [www.archesproject.org](http://www.archesproject.org) for more support.  

## Installation Options  
It's important to recognize that Arches is designed to manage large, enterprise-scale Cultural Heritage inventories.  The software is sophisticated and is designed to be support extensive customization.  This means that there are many ways to deploy Arches.

We've written this guide to streamline the installation of Arches Server and the CDS Package in the more straight-forward manner possible.  These installation instructions provide step-by-step guidelines for installing Arches Server, installing the CDS Package, and configugin Arches for daily use.
