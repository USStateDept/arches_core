#Next Steps: Using Arches
Now that you've installed and configured Arches, you can start building your inventory of cultural heritage.  A few things that you'll probably want to consider:  


##Backup Your Arches Database
Arches uses the PostgreSQL/PostGIS relational database.  You can download an application called PGAdmin ([http://www.pgadmin.org/](http://www.pgadmin.org/)) to ease many of the basic Arches databasem management tasks.  

PGAdmin has a clean and easy-to-understand user interface, and it will make database backups easy.  But be forwarned!  PGAdmin will also allow you to work with every aspect of the Arches data model, so tread carefully!  


##Performance Tuning  
Arches doesn't attempt to tune any of the many performance variables that PostgreSQL exposes.  But, based on the size and complexity of your dataset, you may want to re-allocate system resources to PostgreSQL.  

People have written entire books on how to squeeze the best performance out of data management systems.  Read-up on the basics before you attempt to optimize your system!
