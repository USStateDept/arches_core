# Installing Arches on a Vagrant Development Machine
This chapter summarizes the installation steps a Software Developer should follow for installing Arches on a Vagrant development machine. Developers may wish to install Arches using Vagrant.  Vagrant ensures that all developers can work on the same platform. And if you decide to use a local Mercurial client (like SourceTree), Vagrant will allow you to quickly test your code in a virtual environment.  

Check out [http://www.vagrantup.com/](http://www.vagrantup.com/) for more information.

## Step 1: Download Arches 
Start by getting a copy of the Arches code. You can always find the most up-to-date codebase at:

[https://bitbucket.org/arches/arches/get/default.zip](https://bitbucket.org/arches/arches/get/default.zip)  

Create a folder called Arches on your computer and unzip the archive to this folder.  

Or, consider using a local Mercurial client to manage the Arches codebase locally.
  
## Step 2: Install Vagrant
Navigate to [http://www.vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com); download and install the Vagrant software for your operating system (OS).  

## Step 3: Install VirtualBox
VirtualBox is an open source Virtual Machine application.  

Navigate to [https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org); download and install VirtualBox for your OS.  

## Step 4: Download Virtual Machine File
Open a command prompt and type the following command to download an empty Ubuntu server (version 12.04, 32-bit) VM file 

    vagrant box add precise32 \ http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box

You can consult the Vagrant website if you prefer to use an alternate base OS for your Arches VM.  
 
I>###Pro Tip: Windows Installation
I>For some versions of Windows you may get an error when running the vagrant box add command.  Try running the command again, this time WITHOUT the "/" after the "precise32".  Check the latest vagrant documentation for additional troubleshooting help.  

## Step 5: Build Arches
Open a command prompt and navigate to the Arches folder:

	cd arches

once you've navigated to your arches folder, type:

    vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
    
then:

	vagrant up

I>###Pro Tip: Making Arches run with less than 2 GB of RAM
I>Before you "vagrant up", open this file: arches/Vagrantfile with a text editor.  Scroll down to vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"].  Replace the 2048 with 1024, and Arches will only request 1GB of RAM.  


Vagrant will create a Virtual Machine with a complete Arches install, including all required software dependencies, as well as a sample dataset ready for you to test Arches with.

I>###How long will it take to build Arches?
I>
I> Depending on your computer, it may take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or two to build Arches.You'll know that Arches is ready when the command prompt returns.

## Step 6: Start Arches
At the command prompt type:

    vagrant ssh

This command will log you onto your virtual Linux server.  To start Arches, navigate to the Arches folder in your virtual server.  Run the Arches build script by typing the following command:  

    ./runserver-vagrant.sh

I>###Windows Users: Get an ssh client  
I>Because Windows doesn't usually come with ssh, you'll need to install a ssh client like PuTTY.  See the Vagrant documentation ([http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ssh.html](http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ssh.html)) for more information.  


Arches will start and be ready for use in just a moment or two.  To access Arches, open a browser (note: Arches works with Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer 10 or higher), and type:

[http://localhost:8000/Arches/index.htm#](http://localhost:8000/Arches/index.htm#)  

You should see the following screen:

![Arches Default Screen: Simple Search](images/Arches_Search.png)  

If you want to test adding or editing cultural heritage data in Arches, you'll need to sign in.  Click "Map" in the upper right corner of the screen, then click  

 ![Arches Sign In](images/Arches_login.png)
 
The Username and Password are both "admin" (omit the quotes when entering the username and password).

### A Note on Vagrant
Vagrant is a handy way to quickly set up a server for software testing.  

If you review the Vagrant documents, you'll see that you can halt the Arches VM simply by typing:  

    vagrant halt

Starting Arches again is a simple "vagrant up" command.  You can completely remove Arches from your computer by typing:  

    vagrant destroy

While Vagrant is a great way to evaluate Arches, it's not necessarily the way you'd want to deploy Arches for a project.  For one thing, we haven't built-in a back-up of the Arches database for vagrant.  

So if you "vagrant destroy" your version of Arches, be prepared to lose any data that you may have entered.  Don't worry though.  You can always type "vagrant up" and get a pristine version of Arches running again.
