# The Core Data Standard (CDS) Package
The Arches community has developed the CDS Package v1.0 as an initial data management module for Arches Server v2.0.0.  The CDS Package demonstrates the structure and contents of an Arches Package, and implements the following standards:  

+ CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) ([www.cidoc-crm.org](http://www.cidoc-crm.org)). The CRM provides definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation.
+ International Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage. This is a soon-to-be finalized standard for the inventory of both archaeological and architectural heritage, which is based on the earlier Core Data Index to Historic Buildings and Monuments of the Architectural Heritage (adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992) and the Core Data Standard for Archaeological Sites and Monuments (adopted by CIDOC in 1995). The new standard under preparation (referred to here as the "CDS") was used to identify the data fields of the CDS. Organizations that deploy the CDS can customize those data fields to meet their specific requirements.
 
You may wish to familiarize yourself with these data standards as part of your the CDS installation and deployment effort. If you ever wish to further customize the CDS, familiarity with both will help you greatly along the way.

Some of the key contents of the CDS Package include:  

+ Resource Graphs
+ Authority Documents and Thesauri  
+ Data Import Files

The following sections summarize these components of an Arches Package.  


## Resource Graphs
Arches is designed to manage cultural heritage data anywhere in the world. Needless to say, that's an ambitious goal. After all, architecture considered culturally significant in San Francisco - a city founded in 1776 - might not merit much comment in Cairo or London.

So, how does Arches resolve this?

Arches Server requires a set of Resource Graphs that define the set of resource types that you wish to include in your inventory and the terms that you will use to describe them.

I>### What is an Arches Resource Graph?
I>
I> In Arches, the term "Resource Graph" refers to a class of cultural heritage records. Things like "Architectural Heritage", "Investigation Activity", and "Person" are all examples of Resource Graphs. Think of a Resource Graph as defining the attributes for a particular category of information that Arches will manage.
I>
I> A Resource is simply one instance of a particular Resource Graph.

Resource Graphs are described following the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM). The CRM is an ontology for cultural heritage information that has been developed by a the International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums. Arches uses the CRM because it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization as the standard (ISO 21127:2006) for the interchange of cultural heritage information.


### CDS Package Resource Graphs
The CDS Package defines the following Resource Graphs:   

        ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (ARTIFACT).E18
        ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE (SITE).E27
        ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18
        LANDSCAPE HERITAGE.E27
        MARITIME HERITAGE.E18
        INVESTIGATION.E7
        MANAGEMENT.E7
        DESIGNATION AND PROTECTION.E7
        HISTORICAL EVENT.E5
        DOCUMENT.E31
        IMAGE.E38
        PERSON.E21
        ORGANIZATION.E74

**Heritage Resources:**   
Heritage Resources are archaeological, built, landscape, or other immovable cultural heritage. In the CDS, Heritage Resources include:

Archaeological Heritage (element)
: a single archaeological entity that could stand alone or be an element of a larger archaeological group (e.g., a bath house within a Roman villa)

Archaeological Heritage (site) 
: an area of archaeological potential or an area of known or discovered archaeological elements

Q>####What's the difference between archaeological elements and sites?
Q>
Q>While conceptually these categories overlap, the CDS differentiates between the two because of the way that they are represented using the CIDOC CRM.

Architectural Heritage
: culturally significant buildings, structures, and groups thereof

Landscape Heritage
: areas of land designed and created intentionally by man, such as garden and parkland landscapes constructed for aesthetic reasons, organically evolved areas of land resulting from an initial social, economic, administrative, and/or religious imperative and that has developed its present form by association with and in response to its natural environment, or areas of land that are culturally significant due to powerful religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element rather than material cultural evidence, which may be insignificant or even absent (UNESCO)

Maritime Heritage
: underwater heritage (both under sea and inland), which may include heritage inundated by sea level rise and dam construction, shipwrecks and aircraft, as well as heritage afloat (e.g., ships, sailing vessels)  


**Activities**
Activities are events or actions that may take place during a given time span and at a location or area. In the CDS, Activities include:

Investigation Activity
: an activity undertaken with the explicit intention of gathering information about, and understanding of, a Heritage Resource, and the creation of an information source to record that information and understanding

Management Activity
: an activity undertaken to prevent damage to, promote the survival of, and promote the understanding and appreciation of Heritage Resources.

Designation and Protection Activity
: an activity which implements or revokes statutory and non-statutory designation and protection regimes which may apply to Heritage Resources

Historical Event
: any activity that took place in the past, including both human and natural events  


**Documents** 
Documents are information carriers such as books, texts, periodicals, inscriptions, audio files, video files, 3-D models, or images. In the CDS, Documents include:

Document
: an information carrier, other than an Image, whether physical or digital, eg. books, maps, pdfs, word-processed documents

Image
: an information carrier that represent an external form, whether physical or digital, eg. photographs, slides, drawings, jpegs or tiff files.  


**Actors**  
Actors refer to individuals or groups of people. In the CDS, Actors include:

Person
: real persons (i.e., who live or are assumed to have lived)

Organization
: A group or legally identifiable body  




## Authority Documents
Like any good data-editing tool, Arches supports consistent and valid data entry.  Almost every one is familiar with this concept: it's the ability to select a valid value from a list:

![Selecting a value from a "Controlled Vocabulary"](images/dropdown.png)

Notice that in this Arches data entry form, you're able to select the kind of Archaeological Heritage Element from among the list of approved types or classifications. In Arches, these lists are called "controlled vocabularies".

But what if you want to use a particular list of period names, instead of the names that come with Arches? Arches allows you to define exactly the set of names you want to use for every resource.

### Thesauri
So, why do we use the term "controlled vocabulary" if all we're doing is selecting values from a drop-down list? The answer is that Arches treats each drop-down list as if it's a thesaurus.  

And what's so special about thesauri? They provide a potent way organize concepts and a convenient way to attach labels to concepts. This makes data entry and searching a large database for specific resources much easier.  

Lets say we want to create a list of dwellings where people live as a drop-down list in Arches. Our list might look like this:  

        dwelling
          apartment
          house
          hut
          log cabin
        
The thesaurus allows you to define concepts and give them labels. For example, "dwelling" is the label associated with the concept of "a place where people live."   

Note also that each concept under "dwelling" is a more precise (or narrower) type of dwelling. In this example, there are four additional narrower concepts of dwelling.  One such concept (eg.: a place where families live) has the term "house" associated with it.

This ability to build hierarchies of concepts makes thesauri very powerful. We can use the structure of a thesaurus to help make clear the relationships between concepts.

But wait just a moment. We know that in some areas, people use different terms to mean the same thing. A thesaurus allows us to attach many labels to the same concept. For example:

        dwellings
          apartment
          house [aisled house, bungalow, chalet]
          hut
          log cabin

This is a representation that adds more, alternate labels for the concept "house". In this example, the labels "aisled house," "bungalow," and "chalet" all represent alternate labels for the same concept. Note that we could add "Haus" and "maison" if we wanted to include labels for the same concept in additional languages such as German or French.

It's up to you to decide how you want to organize your terms. Is a "chalet" really an alternate label for house, or should it be considered a narrower concept of dwelling?  

At this point you may be wondering why we've made a simple drop-down list so complicated.  

Well, by using thesauri to power the drop-down lists, Arches will know that when you search for a resource using the term "chalet" you really mean "house".  And if you search for a resource using the term "dwelling", you'll get all the narrower concepts for dwelling, even if you didn't know that a "hut" a "dwelling".  


### Understanding the Structure of an Authority Document
You will have noticed that most of the controlled vocabularies in the CDS package have the words "Authority Document.E32" as part of their file name. This is to make it clear that Arches implements controlled vocabularies in a way that is consistent with the CIDOC CRM.  

Let's look at an authority document in more detail:

    ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32
        
This authority document holds the list of Architectural Heritage types that the CDS will use. Types are just what you'd guess: a list of the kinds of Architectural Heritage that you will allow people to choose from when they enter a new Architectural Heritage resource into Arches.  

Your ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE Authority Document can contain any entries that you think are appropriate. Here are some examples:

    Air Raid Siren
    Church
    House
    Chalet
    Fountain
    Street Lamp
                
Adding these concepts to Arches would require you to update the Architectural Heritage authority document. The good news is that all Arches authority files are simple text files with the following 5 columns:

ConceptID
: a unique identifier for the concept  

PrefLabel
: the default label that you wish to use for this concept  

AltLabels
: alternative ways to identify the concept  

Parent ConceptID
: the unique identifier of a broader concept (this will construct hierarchies)

Provider
: identifies the source of the concept  
  
Building an authority document is just a matter of adding a row for every concept that you want to include in your drop down lists.  In our example, the authority document might look like this:


|ConceptID   |PrefLabel           |AltLabels            |Parent ConceptID  |Provider  |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|  
|1           |Air Raid Siren      |                     |                  |EH        |
|2           |Church              |House of Worship     |                  |EH        |
|3           |House               |                     |                  |EH        |
|4           |Chalet              |                     |3                 |EH        |
|5           |Fountain            |fount;jet;spout      |                  |EH        |
|6           |Street Lamp         |                     |                  |EH        |

Notice that in one line, we can add a concept, define its preferred label, optionally provide alternate labels, and define broader/narrower relationships between concepts.

There are a few things to be aware of:

W>## ConceptIDs must be unique! 
W>Make sure that you use a truly unique identifier for each record that you want to load into Arches.  


I>## Use a semicolon to separate more than one Alternate Labels
I>Commas are used to separate columns, so we need a different way to indicate all the different alternate labels for a concept
I>
  
I>## Narrower Terms
I>Use the ConceptID of the broader term in the "Parent ConceptID" field if you want to tell Arches that concepts are related. Arches will use this information to make searching the inventory better and more intuitive. 

I>###Required Terms  
I>Arches has only one required term: The term "Primary" is required to appear in NAME TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32. Why? Because Arches supports multiple names for any resource, it needs a way to define the preferred name for a resource.  

### Understanding Authority Document Values
You might have noticed that a few Authority Documents seem to come in pairs.  For example:  

    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv
    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv

What's going on here? Sometimes its convenient to know a bit more about some of the concepts in a thesaurus than just a set of labels and its parent. For example, when discussing specific cultural periods (such as "Middle Paleolithic"), it's often useful to reference the start and end years of the period.

Arches "values" files let us do this. Open CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv and you'll see the following:  

![Cultural Period Values](images/Periods_values.png)

Note the first row in this file: **conceptid**, **Value**, **Value Type**, **Provider**  

These headers define a simple structure of the value file. You simply have to reference a conceptID from the CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv file, provide the value and its "type", and the provider of the value.

For cultural periods, the values file allows you to attach the start year and end year for each Period concept in the CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv file. Look at lines 7 and 9 in the image above and you will see:  

    7  PERIOD_UID:55, -150000, minimum date, EH  
    9  PERIOD_UID:55, -40000, maximum date, EH  

If you look up "PERIOD_UID:55" in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv, you'll see that it's record is:  

    PERIOD_UID:55,MIDDLE PALAEOLITHIC,,PERIOD_UID:5,EH
    
So, in the CDS pacakge, the default list of Cultural Periods includes the Middle Palaeolithic (as "PERIOD_UID:55" in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv), and that period is defined to start at -150,000 years (row 7 in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv) and end at -40,000 years (row 9 in the same file).  

#### What Value Types Can I Define?
You can define any set of key/value pairs that you wish.  Arches will load your values and associate them with the concept identifier that you provide.  

By default, Arches defines values for the following Authority Document value files:  

    ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  
    ARCHES RESOURCE CROSS-REFERENCE RELATIONSHIP TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  
    CONDITION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  
    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  
    TYPE OF DESIGNATION OR PROTECTION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  
    UNIT OF MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv  

If you look at these files, you'll see that Arches already knows how to handle the following value types:  

**SortOrder**  
You can use the *.values.csv file to define the order in which terms appear for:  

    UNIT OF MEASUREMENT AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv
    TYPE OF DESIGNATION OR PROTECTION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32csv
    CONDITION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv

**Minimum Date, Maximum Date**  
You can use the *.values.csv file to define the starting and ending dates for:  

    CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv

**Geometry, Administrative Area Type**  
You can use the ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.values.csv file to define administrative subdivision types and the geometry associated with each administrative area. For example:

    LOC_UID:97317,PARISH,admin area type filter,EH

would define the concept LOC_UID:97317 (in the ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv file) as an "admin area type filter" with a value of "PARISH".  And  


    LOC_UID:97345,"POLYGON((-1.32078640715254 54.3728610449506,-1.33713112471483 54.3586411276027,-1.3584180849332 54.371070777731,-1.34399265906457 54.376710180739,-1.32078640715254 54.3728610449506))",geometry,EH

would define the concept LOC_UID:97345 (in the ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISION AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv file) as having a geometry with a set of particular coordinates that make up a polygon.

**Resource Cross-Reference, Cross-Reference Type Filter**
Arches allows you to build relationships between resources. For example, you can relate a Person resource to an Architectural Heritage resource. Arches implements an Authority File that allows you to define the types relationships between resources.  

    ARCHES RESOURCE CROSS-REFERENCE RELATIONSHIP TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32
    
    
**Custom Key/Values Pairs**  
Arches will allow you to load any set of key/value pairs, treating the information that you load as descriptive data about the concept.  

If you want to use your key/value pairs to support data entry (like the from/to dates for Cultural Periods), you may need to extend the Arches codebase he codebase to use your key/value pairs.  


### Modifying the Default Authority Files
The CDS package comes with a set of concepts and labels for each controlled vocabulary. Of course, you are welcome to use the package defaults but you'll probably want to use your own concepts and terms.  

To modify the default authority files, just open an authority document with a text editor and begin. You can remove records from a file, or add new records that better represent the concepts, labels, and concept-relationships that you use to describe cultural heritage.

I>###Back up the original Authority Documents First!
I>It's a good idea to make copies of the original files, just in case you want to go back and confirm that your edits make sense.

I>###Don't Forget about the "values" Files!
I> If you change an Authority Document that has an associated values file, you'll want to make sure that the conceptIDs match between the Authority Document and the corresponding value file. By the way, Arches will work without any "values" files.  They're just a convenient way to augment Authority Documents.  

The CDS includes 13 Resource Types grouped into four categories. And each resource has a set of attributes associated with it. The CDS comes with a default set of controlled vocabularies and automatically matches each vocabulary with the appropriate resource attribute.

In Arches the term "Authority Documents" is used to denote the files that hold the concepts, preferred label, alternate labels, and parent concept (to support hierarchies of concepts) for each drop-down list. Some Authority Documents are common to all Resource Types, while others are particular to specific categories of Resource Types. Here is a list of all of them:

**Authority Documents common to all Resource Types:**

You can find all the Authority Documents in the following folder:

     source_data/concepts/authority_files

I>## What's up with all the ".E Numbers"?
I> Resource Types, attributes, and all other entities in the CDS are instances of CIDOC CRM classes. The CRM uses a "E.xx" naming style to define its classes, so we append the CRM class identifier to our CDS entities so that its clear what each CDS entity actually represents.


## Data Import Files
As you've seen, the CDS package comes with the following 13 Resource Types: 

* Heritage Resources
	* Archaeological Heritage (element)
	* Archaeological Heritage (site)
	* Architectural Heritage
	* Landscape Heritage
	* Maritime Heritage
* Activities
	* Investigation activity
	* Management activity
	* Designation and protection activity
	* Historical event
* Documents
	* Document
	* Image
* Actors
	* Person
	* Organization

Each of these Resource Types has a set of attributes. Attributes are really just pieces of information about each resource. For example, one of the Attributes of the Archaeological Heritage (Element) resource is its cultural period. In the Arches user interface, Attributes are organized into Information Themes. See the companion **Arches User Guide** for more information on the user interface.

Some attributes are common to many Resource Types. "Name" is a good example, which is common to all Resource Types. Every resource can have a name associated with it. Most Resource Types have quite a few attributes.

I>###Why do I need to know about attributes?  
I>If you already have heritage data in a database or spreadsheet, you can build a file that will let you import your data into Arches. And to do this, you need to know exactly which attributes each resource has. 

To see exactly which attributes are associated with a resource, open the this file:  
  
    Arches/db/ETL/CDS Package/Mappings/CDS attributes.csv

Here are the first few records of CDS attributes.csv:

![Resources Attributes.txt](images/Resource_Attributes.png)

Each line in this file simply states that an Arches resource has an attribute that is associated with it. Notice the three columns:

**ResourceType**: The Arches Resource Type of the Resource
**AttributeName**: The attribute associated with the Resource Type  
**AuthorityDocument**: If this column is populated, then the attribute value must be a unique identifier found in the authority file that is named in this column.

You can think of the Resource Attributes.txt file as a listing of the set of data that you can load into Arches.  

I>## What's up with all the ".E Numbers"?
I> Resources, attributes, and all other entities in Arches are instances of CIDOC CRM classes.  The CRM uses a "E.xx" naming style to define its classes, so we append the CRM class identifier to our Arches entities so that its clear what each Arches entity actually represents.

### Creating a Data Import File
The CDS comes with a file that you can use to load information into Arches.  The is located at:  

    source_data/resource_info.csv

The package reads the content of resource_info.csv and loads it into a database. If you open this file from the CDS package, you'll see that it already contains data for a set of heritage resources.  You'll need to replace the information in this file with your own data if you want to automatically populate Arches with data.  

By the way, don't let the file name fool you, "resource_info.csv" is a | delimited file (a "pipe" delimited file) that illustrates the structure of a valid Arches import file.

I>###Why use a "|" instead of commas?
I>The Arches import file allows you to include text blocks (so that you can import free text). Text often includes commas, but rarely includes a |.  So we use the | character to distinguish columns in the resource_info.csv file.  

Here are some representative records from a load file: 

![Resource_Info.csv](images/Resource_Load.png)

And here's how to understand what's going on: Each line in the file defines a resource and an attribute to load into Arches. Each of the column headers **RESOURCEID**, **RESOURCETYPE**, **ATTRIBUTENAME**, **ATTRIBUTEVALUE**, and **GROUPID** define the content of the file.  Most are self-explanatory, with the exception of the "GROUPID" field (which we'll look at in more detail later).

Let's look at line 1: 

    15897|ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18|COMPILER.E82|ROD FITZGERALD|COMPILER.E82-0

This record tells Arches that:  

+ We're going to load information about an "ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18" resource (**RESOURCETYPE**)
+ Our resource can be uniquely identified by the string "15897" (**RESOURCEID**)
+ We're going to load a value for the "COMPILER.E82" attribute (**ATTRIBUTENAME**)
+ The value of the Compiler.E82 attribute is "ROD FITZGERALD" (**ATTRIBUTEVALUE**)  
+ This record is part of a group of records identified as "COMPILER.E82-0" (**GROUPID**)  

Notice that we can import lots of information about a single resource simply by referencing the same **RESOURCEID** and **RESOURCETYPE**.  

### Adding Multiple Values to an Attribute
Why all this formalism and complexity?  
 
Because many cultural heritage objects have more than value for a given attribute. For example, a single resource can often have many names. Or the characteristics of a resource may change over time. Without allowing for multiple values for an attribute, Arches wouldn't be able to track the evolution of a resource.  

So, the Arches data import file structure is important because many resource attributes may have multiple values. Indeed, an Architectural Heritage resource may be associated with several cultural periods, have many addresses, and have several protection grades. 

That's why Arches allows you load many attribute values for a single resource attribute.    

Notice in the file shown that we can add several compilers into Arches for the same resource.  In fact, lines 3, 4, and 5 also define compilation records.  In general, Arches will allow you to add multiple values for a given attribute.  

I>###Single Attributes
I>At present, Arches' user interface can show multiple values for all entities except for the Summary Description, Distinguishing Features, and Location Description entities.  

  

### Attribute Goups
Now look at lines 8 through 11 in the example file.  

Individually, each row assigns a value for a specific attribute. The FROM DATE.E49 and TO DATE.E49 attributes are years. Line 8 seems to be describing a Cultural Period, and Line 10 the Architectural Resource type.  

But notice that each record in rows 8 through 11 all share the same "PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0" **GROUPID**.  This means that these 4 records together describe a resource.

By grouping these rows together with the same **GROUPID**, you can tell Arches that these 4 records are not independent; rather together they describe the resource.  

Here's how to interpret what's going on. Each of the records starts with:

    15897|ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18
    
This means that each record contains information about the Architectural Heritage.E18 Resource with the unique identifier of 15897. Okay, let's focus on what comes next:  

     8  CULTURAL PERIOD.E55|PERIOD_UID:28|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
     9  FROM DATE.E49|1066|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
    10  ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE.E55|AH:THE_TE_UID:68841|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0
    11  TO DATE.E49|1540|PHASE TYPE ASSIGNMENT.E17-0

Look at line 8. Its **ATTRIBUTENAME** is "CULTURAL PERIOD.E55", and the value of this attribute is "PERIOD_UID:28". Recall from the Chapter "Step 3: Load Controlled Vocabularies" that we use an Authority Document for Cultural Periods. So, the **ATTRIBUTEVALUE** "PERIOD_UID:28" in line 8 is a pointer to a concept in CULTURAL PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv (which works out to "Medieval"). 

OK, now look at line 9.  Its **ATTRIBUTENAME** is "FROM DATE.E49" and its **ATTRIBUTEVALUE** is "1066".  Simple enough: "from date" is the year 1066.  

Line 10 tells Arches to use the unique identifier "AH:THE_TE_UID:68841" in ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32.csv to define the value for "ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE TYPE.E55" (a "Motte"), and line 11 says that the resource has a "TO DATE.E49" value of "1540".

And here's the payoff: by giving these 4 records the same **GROUPID**, we are telling Arches that:

>"The ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE.E18 resource with unique identifier of "15897" was a "Motte" during the "Medieval" cultural period, specifically between the years 1066 and 1540."

Recall that Arches will support many combinations of cultural period, heritage type, and from/to dates for a single resource.  

Now, we can understand that the purpose of the **GROUPID** is to allow for grouping a set of related attributes into a coherent record.  

The actual values that you use for **GROUPID** are arbitrary, just make sure that you use a unique value for each set of attributes that you want to group.  

I>## Required Data  
I>By design, Arches can accommodate a wide variety of data. The only real data requirement is this: **If you want to name a resource, you must provide one name with a NAME TYPE.E55 of "Primary."**  Because you can give a resource as many names as you want, Arches uses the "Primary" designation to identify the preferred name of the resource.  

### Which Attributes can be Grouped?
Not all attributes can (or should) be grouped together. Based on the *Core Data Standard for Archaeological and Architectural Heritage* (introduced in the "Deploying Arches" chapter), Arches allows for the following attributes to be grouped: 

+ **NAME.E41** and **NAME TYPE.E55**   
+ **SPATIAL COORDINATES_GEOMETRY.E47** and **SPATIAL COORDINATES QUALIFIER**  
+ Any combination of attributes starting with **ADRESS_**  
+ Any combination of **PERIOD AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32**, **FROM DATE.E49**, **TO DATE.E49**, and **HERITAGE RESOURCE TYPE AUTHORITY DOCUMENT.E32** (e.g.: Archaeological Heritage (Element), Archaeological Heritage (Site), Architectural Heritage, Landscape Heritage, Maritime Heritgae)

### Loading the Data File
Once you've prepared your data load file, you may insert its contents into Arches.  Be sure to confirm that you are referencing your Authority Documents properly (e.g.: the unique ID you use in your load file should also exist in the appropriate Authority Document).  

Arches will load and index each of the cultural heritage data records that you've defined in your data file.  Don't worry if it takes a few attempts to get your data to load cleanly. You can always re-run the Arches build scripts to get a pristine instance of Arches.
