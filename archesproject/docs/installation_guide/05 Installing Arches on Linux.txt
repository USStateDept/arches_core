# Installing Arches on a Linux (Ubuntu 12.04)
The following instructions were written with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in mind. Other versions of Ubuntu or other Linux distributions might have some different steps, but the general outline should be similar. All instructions assume that they are entered through the terminal and that the user has root privileges. Installing on alternate flavors of Linux will follow a similar pattern.  

Of course, you may use the same instructions to install Arches either an in-house or remote server. And, while this guide does not cover it, Arches can be installed across multiple machines for deployments that demand high fault tolerance.


## Step 1: Download Arches 
Create the following folder on your computer:  

    arches-web

Download the Arches v2.0 code [http://archesproject.org/download-arches/](http://archesproject.org/download-arches/) and copy it to the archesproject folder (be sure and unzip if necessary).  


## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies 
This step installs PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GEOS and the latest JDK by running a single script.  

I>If you would rather install the components seperately, simply open the script file and run only the portions of the script you want.

Open a terminal and navigate to:  

    archesproject/install
    
Run the following script to build install PostgreSql, PostGIS, GEOS and the latest JDK: 

	source linux_setup.sh


W>###PostgreSQL Warnings
W>If you experience errors during the installation, please check that the setting 'standard_conforming_strings' in 'postgresql.conf' is uncommented and set to 'off'. See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7667724/error-saving-geodjango-pointfield](this question on stackoverflow) for more information.  


## Step 3: Install Web Framework and Search Engine
Arches uses the Django web framework ([https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) and the ElasticSearch engine ([http://www.elasticsearch.org/](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)).  This step installs these technologies.  Open a command window and navigate to:  

    archesproject/install
    
Then run the following script:  

	source install_dependencies.sh

Once this script runs you'll need to start the Django development server and ElasticSearch search engine, by navigating to the root folder and running the following script:  

    source runserver.sh  

I> We use the Django development server to make it easy for you to confirm that Arches has installed properly.  You WILL NEED to configure Arches to use a production quality web server such as Apache if you want to use Arches in production.  See the chapter on Arches configuration for guidance on how to complete this step.
   
    
## Step 4: Install and Build Arches
Open a new terminal window, and navigate to:  

    archesproject/build  
    
Run the following script to build core Arches:  

    source install_arches_db.sh

I>###Database Password  
I>You may be prompted for a password to the Arches database.  The default password is: postgis.  You can open Settings.py in the arches root folder to change the default arches password, or to install Arches on to an existing instance of PostgreSQL/PostGIS.  


## Next Steps
You've just completed the steps needed to install the core Arches application on your Windows server.  You can confirm that Arches installed properly by typing the following URL

	http://localhost:8000/Arches/index.htm

Arches requires that you load a data management package before you can start working with your cultural heritage data.  Jump to the chapter entitled **Loading the CDS Package**  to install a cultural heritage data management package based on the CIDOC Core Data Standard.  

You may also check the archesproject.org website to see whether the community has developed other data management packages.  

It's also possible to create your own Arches Data Management Package.  You'll want to review an existing package (such as the CDS Package) to see how to structure an Arches package.  You can find more information on creating packages by joining the Arches Discussion Forum ([http://archesproject.org/forum/](http://archesproject.org/forum/)).
